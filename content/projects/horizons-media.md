#### The Conference

Horizons Media NYC started out as a not-for-profit annual conference for clinical research in psychedelics. The community grew exponentially over the course of 13+ years, accumulating more than 2,800 attendees, and pioneering the way for celebrating, sharing and growing a community for psychedelics research in the US.

#### The Impact of Coronavirus

As a former volunteer coordinator, I grew through positions as a production associate to marketing director. When COVID-19 hit, Horizons had to make a shift to a more sustainable and remote model. I was recruited as a UX/UI designer/Squarespace developer and consultant: I help research and consult on different digital solutions for their new business model, in which they would create year-round programming (both remote and, when the time comes, live events) and implement a subscription/membership based structure and workflow. 

Due to my long-standing relationship with Horizons, I understand its mission and the priorities in this business-model shift for its core/tight knit communities. The rise of mainstream interest in psychedelics gave them an advantage in the global pandemic. 

#### The Challenge

At the beginning of the pandemic, my priorities were to help them streamline their community building and structure a workflow that would reflect the value of membership and contributing to the Horizons community-- all the while with a strict budget and the risk that people would not have the economic interest in investing/ continuing to invest in Horizons.  The production team is small, and the "departments" of the organization are made up of singular individuals: while they understood the shift to a membership/subscription model would be significant, they also wanted to 

1. lessen the overhead in learning new software, 
2. lessen the risk of creating a new website or designing new workflow
3. execute consistent messaging and brand authenticity while making the shift. 

#### The Designs

We went through several iterations of different pages on Squarespace; I would code custom, hard-coded components in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as requested. Sometimes I'd pitch different component designs (i.e. a menu page for different membership options). As they evolved in aesthetic and voice, we improved and elevated the brand to have fresher colors, a simpler workflow, and more iconic photo assets. 

Along with the changing look and feel of the website, I helped custom code templates, customize icons, and email-components for their Mailchimp campaigns.

#### The Workflow

Because of the project constraints, we decided to stick with their Squarespace website, and I set up the Memberspace plugin to allow a login wall for members-only content. I helped them trace a workflow from Memberspace/Squarespace to Mailchimp, their current customer management system. I also consulted and helped research workflows for different types of platforms and softwares.
