#### Freaking What I Got

As a former marketing manager and event producer, my shift towards User Experience was a no-brainer.

I bring a useful set of skills to shaping a productâ€“ from macro-level creative strategies to how solid brand strategies can reproduce authentic brand & campaign experiences.

#### Brand Strategy 

My digital marketing and management background provide a holistic perspective on how to discover, shape, and implement a cohesive and consistent brand strategy.

I also consult re-branding processes: discovery and research to modernize, stylize, or profiling your target audience. brand

#### Creative Design 

I use Adobe Illustrator for Illustrations, graphic design, and iconography. While I am familiar with Adobe XD and Figma, I mostly use Sketch for UX wireframes and product design mockups.

#### Execution & Code

I work in HTML/CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, and Markdown. Past WeChat Mini Program projects were coded in MINA (native WeChat framework), and include wxcss and wxml.

#### Clients Include 

The Food Ranger, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Mandarin Blueprint, The Talking Body, Paw Prints, Le Wagon, The Range Bar & Grill, Crate Coffee, King Sizzle Sausages, Second Hand Second Story, JS Power, and more.
